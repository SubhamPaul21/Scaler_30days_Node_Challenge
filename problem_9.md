## Answer is d: All of the above.

### Express --> Express.js, or simply Express, is a back end web application framework for building RESTful APIs with Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs. It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.

### Body-parser --> Body-parser is the Node.js body-parsing middleware. It is responsible for parsing the incoming request bodies in a middleware before you handle it. 

### Socket.io ---> Socket.IO is an event-driven library for real-time web applications. It enables real-time, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers. It consists of two components: a client, and a server. Both components have a nearly identical API.
